# SWAPI

# Overview

The good folks at [SWAPI (swapi.dev)](https://swapi.dev/) have done a great job of cataloging a lot of data associated with the Star Wars universe into a simple REST API. You can find the docs to the API [here](https://swapi.dev/). But they missed a lot of features like search, sort etc. which could have been very handy to high school students to do research on SWAPI for their school project.

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to help these kids and come up with a caching engine/server for the above API & provide the data in a way that enables their use-case.

The challenge has been kept open-ended to give you some room to exercise your creativity both in terms of what features you think will be helpful to the persona (high school students) & how you build it, you can pick any framework, any database, follow any design pattern based on your choice, the goal is to achieve optimal solution keeping in mind the use-case mentioned above.

## You can follow the below objectives:
